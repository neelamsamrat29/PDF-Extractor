# PDF-Extractor
I developed a Python tool to extract text and images from a PDF using PyMuPDF and Pillow. The extracted content was structured into a JSON file, including text and image paths. The code was modularized into separate scripts for text extraction, image extraction, and JSON generation, making it easy to maintain and extend.

For this project, I created a Python-based system that can process a PDF document by extracting its text and images and structuring the information. I handled and saved the images using Pillow and extracted the text using PyMuPDF (fitz). A JSON structure was then created by combining the extracted content. To make the code more modular and maintainable, the project was divided into distinct modules: one for text extraction, another for image extraction, and a final one for producing the JSON output. I now have a better understanding of how to programmatically handle PDFs, modularize code for readability, and organize data for useful purposes.

# PDF-Extractor
I developed a Python tool to extract text and images from a PDF using PyMuPDF and Pillow. The extracted content was structured into a JSON file, including text and image paths. The code was modularized into separate scripts for text extraction, image extraction, and JSON generation, making it easy to maintain and extend.
